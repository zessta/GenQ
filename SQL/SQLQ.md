Sure, here are SQL topics classified into easy, medium, and hard categories for preparing interview questions for software engineers:

### Easy

1. **Basic Queries**: SELECT, FROM, WHERE
   - Write a query to select specific columns from a table.
   - Filter records using the WHERE clause.

2. **Sorting and Limiting Results**: ORDER BY, LIMIT
   - Sort records by a specific column.
   - Limit the number of results returned.

3. **Basic Joins**: INNER JOIN
   - Retrieve data from multiple tables using INNER JOIN.

4. **Aggregate Functions**: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX
   - Calculate the total number of records.
   - Find the average value of a column.

5. **Grouping Data**: GROUP BY, HAVING
   - Group data by a specific column and use aggregate functions.
   - Filter groups using the HAVING clause.

6. **Basic Subqueries**:
   - Use a subquery in a WHERE clause to filter results.

### Medium

1. **Advanced Joins**: LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN
   - Retrieve data from multiple tables using different types of joins.

2. **Complex Subqueries**:
   - Use subqueries in SELECT, FROM, and HAVING clauses.

3. **Set Operations**: UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT
   - Combine results from multiple queries using UNION.
   - Find common records using INTERSECT.
   - Find records in one query but not in another using EXCEPT.

4. **Window Functions**: ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, NTILE
   - Use window functions to perform calculations across a set of table rows.

5. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
   - Create and use CTEs for better readability and organization of complex queries.

6. **String Functions**: CONCAT, SUBSTRING, LENGTH
   - Manipulate string data using various string functions.

7. **Date and Time Functions**: CURRENT_DATE, DATEADD, DATEDIFF
   - Perform operations on date and time data.

8. **Indexes and Performance Tuning**:
   - Understand the impact of indexes on query performance.
   - Basic performance tuning techniques.

### Hard

1. **Advanced Window Functions**: LEAD, LAG, FIRST_VALUE, LAST_VALUE
   - Use advanced window functions for complex calculations.

2. **Recursive Queries**:
   - Write recursive queries using CTEs to traverse hierarchical data.

3. **Pivot and Unpivot**:
   - Transform rows into columns and vice versa using PIVOT and UNPIVOT.

4. **Dynamic SQL**:
   - Construct and execute dynamic SQL statements.

5. **Transactions and Concurrency Control**:
   - Understand and implement transactions.
   - Handle concurrency issues with isolation levels and locking mechanisms.

6. **Stored Procedures and Functions**:
   - Create and use stored procedures and functions for reusable code.

7. **Triggers**:
   - Implement triggers to automatically perform actions in response to certain events on a table.

8. **Advanced Indexing and Query Optimization**:
   - Use advanced indexing techniques.
   - Deep dive into query execution plans and optimization strategies.

9. **Data Warehousing Concepts**:
   - Understand star and snowflake schemas.
   - Write queries for data warehousing scenarios.

10. **Security**:
    - Implement user roles and permissions.
    - Understand and apply SQL injection prevention techniques.
