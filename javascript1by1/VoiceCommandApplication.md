Create a testable code that creates the following application and can be used on coding platforms like hackerrank or coderbyte. Introduce some mistakes to it so that you can test the interviewee with the main concepts mentioned:-
### 42. **Voice Command Application**
   **Description:** Create an application that responds to voice commands to perform tasks.
   **Skills Tested:** Web Speech API, DOM manipulation, event handling.
   **Features:**
   - Recognize and process voice commands.
   - Perform tasks based on commands (e.g., search, navigate, control media).
   - Provide feedback and confirmation for commands.
   - Support custom command configurations.
"""
Certainly! Here is a testable code snippet for a Voice Command Application. The code includes some intentional mistakes to test the interviewee's understanding of the main concepts.

        }

        recognition.continuous = true;

        recognition.onresult = function(event) {
            var command = event.results[0][0].transcript.trim();
            document.getElementById('feedback').innerText = "You said: " + command;

            document.getElementById('status').innerText = "Error occurred in recognition: " + event.error;
        };


        // Process the voice command
        function processCommand(command) {
            if (command === "search") {
                window.location.href = "https://www.google.com/search?q=test";
            } else if (command === "navigate") {
                window.location.href = "https://www.example.com";
            } else if (command === "play music") {
                var audio = new Audio('music.mp3');
                audio.play();
            } else {
                document.getElementById('feedback').innerText = "Command not recognized.";
            }
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```


### Intentional Mistakes:
1. **Recognition Initialization**: The browser check only alerts the user but does not prevent further execution if the browser is unsupported.
2. **Recognition Scope**: `webkitSpeechRecognition` is not supported in all browsers. Using `SpeechRecognition` as a fallback is more robust.
3. **Continuous Recognition**: The recognition is continuous, which may not be desired for a simple command application.
4. **Command Handling**: The `processCommand` function has hardcoded commands and does not support custom configurations.
5. **Result Indexing**: `event.results[0][0].transcript` should properly iterate through the results for more robust handling.
6. **Error Handling**: The error message should be more user-friendly.


### Points to Test:
1. **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure the application correctly handles unsupported browsers.
2. **Voice Recognition**: Ensure commands are recognized and processed correctly.
3. **Event Handling**: Ensure events (click, recognition result, error) are handled properly.
4. **DOM Manipulation**: Ensure the feedback and status updates are correct.
5. **Custom Command Configurations**: Ask the interviewee to modify the code to support custom commands.


This code serves as a good starting point to test an interviewee's understanding and ability to debug and enhance the application.
