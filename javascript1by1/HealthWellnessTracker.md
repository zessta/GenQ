Implementation of a Health and Wellness Tracker in JavaScript that includes some intentional mistakes. This code can be used to test data handling, DOM manipulation, and event handling skills. The mistakes are introduced to assess the interviewee's debugging and problem-solving abilities.

### Intentional Mistakes:
1. The `parseInt` function is used without specifying a radix.
2. The `innerText` property is used instead of `innerHTML` for the `tips-display`.
3. The initial values for water intake, sleep, and exercise are set to `0` which might not be realistic for a userï¿½s initial data.
4. The check for tips is inclusive, meaning it also triggers when goals are met exactly, which might not be the intended behavior.


These mistakes should help assess the candidate's ability to identify and correct issues related to data handling, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
