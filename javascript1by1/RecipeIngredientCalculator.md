IPrompt3 = f""" Create a testable code that creates the following application and can be used on coding platforms like hackerrank or coderbyte. Introduce some mistakes to it so that you can test the interviewee with the main concepts mentioned:- Recipe Ingredient Calculator Description: Create an ingredient calculator that adjusts ingredient quantities based on the number of servings. Skills Tested: DOM manipulation, event handling, arithmetic operations. Features:

Input recipe ingredients with quantities for a default number of servings.
Allow users to adjust the number of servings.
Automatically update ingredient quantities based on the new serving size. """
Sure, here is a version of the Interactive Quiz App with intentional mistakes that can be used to test the interviewee's skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, and data handling:

Here are the intentional mistakes introduced in the code:

The score is being updated and displayed inside the checkAnswer function, which might not always correctly reflect the state when moving to the next question.
The nextQuestion function does not disable the answer buttons, which means the user can still click on them even after moving to the next question.
There's no mechanism to restart the quiz or properly handle the end of the quiz beyond disabling the "Next" button.
The nextQuestion function does not remove previous event listeners from the answer elements, potentially causing unexpected behavior.
The interviewee should identify these issues and correct them to ensure the application works as expected.
