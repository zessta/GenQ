# Question 1


# 0 - Topics: Multithreading, Concurrency, Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)


# 1 - Scenario: A software team is working on a web scraping project where they need to fetch data from multiple URLs
#  simultaneously. They decided to use multithreading for concurrent execution. The junior developer in the team wrote the
#  following python code for the same but the code doesn't seem to be working as expected.


# 2 - Code:


# ```python
import threading
import urllib.request




class FetchUrls(threading.Thread):
    def __init__(self, urls, output):
        threading.Thread.__init__(self)
        self.urls = urls
        self.output = output
       
    def run(self):
        while self.urls:
            url = self.urls.pop()
            result = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
            self.output.write(result.read())
        return




def main(urls, output_path):
    f = open(output_path, 'w')
    fetcher = FetchUrls(urls, f)
    fetcher.start()
# ```


# 3 - Question: Can you find out what's wrong with this code? The developer seems to miss out on some important concepts
#  of threading and concurrency.


# 4 - Explanation: The FetchUrls thread is not thread-safe. The urls are shared among all threads but python list
#  is not thread-safe. Also, file write operation is also not thread-safe. This code will lead to race conditions.


# 5 - Answer:


# ```python
import threading
import urllib.request
import queue




class FetchUrls(threading.Thread):
    def __init__(self, queue, output):
        threading.Thread.__init__(self)
        self.queue = queue
        self.output = output




    def run(self):
        while True:
            url = self.queue.get()
            result = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
            self.output.write(result.read())
            self.queue.task_done()




def main(urls, output_path):
    url_queue = queue.Queue()
    output = open(output_path, 'w')
    for url in urls:
        url_queue.put(url)
    for _ in range(5):
        fetcher = FetchUrls(url_queue, output)
        fetcher.start()
    url_queue.join()
    output.close()
# ```
