Question 1

#### 0 - Topics
- Blueprints for Modular Applications
- Application Factories

#### 1 - Scenario
You are working on a large-scale web application and decide to use Flask Blueprints to modularize your application. You also want to implement the application factory pattern to create instances of your app with different configurations.

#### 2 - Code
```python
from flask import Flask, Blueprint, render_template

# Define a blueprint
main = Blueprint('main', __name__)

@main.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

def create_app():
    app = Flask(__name__)

    # Configuration settings
    app.config['DEBUG'] = True

    # Register blueprint
    app.register_blueprint(main, url_prefix='/main')

    return app

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = create_app()
    app.run()
```

#### 3 - Question
There is an issue with the way the blueprint and the application factory pattern are used in the above code. Identify and explain the issue.

#### 4 - Explanation
The issue is that the template folder is not specified for the Blueprint, and the URL prefix for the Blueprint is set incorrectly. Without specifying the template folder for the Blueprint, Flask won't be able to locate the templates associated with it. Additionally, the URL prefix should typically be more descriptive to avoid conflicts.

#### 5 - Answer
```python
from flask import Flask, Blueprint, render_template

# Define a blueprint with a template folder
main = Blueprint('main', __name__, template_folder='templates')

@main.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

def create_app():
    app = Flask(__name__)

    # Configuration settings
    app.config['DEBUG'] = True

    # Register blueprint with a proper URL prefix
    app.register_blueprint(main, url_prefix='/main')

    return app

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = create_app()
    app.run()
```
