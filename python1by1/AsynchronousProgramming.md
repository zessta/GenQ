Question 7

#### 0 - Topics
- Asynchronous Programming with Flask and AsyncIO
- Concurrent Requests Handling

#### 1 - Scenario
You want to enhance your Flask application to handle asynchronous tasks using AsyncIO to improve its performance under heavy load.

#### 2 - Code
```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
import asyncio

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/data')
async def get_data():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulate an asynchronous task
    data = {'value': 'This is async data'}
    return jsonify(data)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

#### 3 - Question
Identify and explain the issues with the asynchronous handling implementation in the above code.

#### 4 - Explanation
Flask's default server does not support asynchronous endpoints out-of-the-box. Using async functions with Flask requires an ASGI server such as Uvicorn or Hypercorn to handle asynchronous requests.

#### 5 - Answer
```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
import asyncio
import os
from hypercorn.asyncio import serve
from hypercorn.config import Config

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/data')
async def get_data():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulate an asynchronous task
    data = {'value': 'This is async data'}
    return jsonify(data)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    config = Config()
    config.bind = ["0.0.0.0:5000"]
    asyncio.run(serve(app, config))
```

These questions focus on sophisticated topics like efficient large file handling, role-based access control, API documentation with Flask-RESTPlus, and asynchronous programming with Flask, ensuring that they are challenging for senior developers.
