Question 3

Certainly! Here's another scenario that tests advanced concepts in Pandas:

0 - Real-life Application of Pandas: Market Basket Analysis

1 - Scenario: 
You are working on a project where you need to analyze transaction data from a retail store to perform market basket analysis. Your task involves preprocessing the data, identifying frequent itemsets, and generating association rules to understand purchasing patterns.

2 - Buggy Code:
```python
import pandas as pd
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import association_rules

# Load transaction data
df = pd.read_csv('transaction_data.csv')

# Convert data to transaction format
transactions = df.groupby('TransactionID')['Item'].apply(list)

# One-hot encode the transaction data
one_hot_encoded = pd.get_dummies(transactions.apply(pd.Series).stack()).sum(level=0)

# Find frequent itemsets using Apriori algorithm
frequent_itemsets = apriori(one_hot_encoded, min_support=0.1, use_colnames=True)

# Generate association rules
rules = association_rules(frequent_itemsets, metric='lift', min_threshold=1.0)

# Save the association rules to a new CSV file
rules.to_csv('association_rules.csv')
```

3 - Question: 
Explain what issue you encounter in the code.

4 - Explanation: 
The code attempts to perform market basket analysis but has issues with preprocessing the transaction data, one-hot encoding, and generating association rules.

5 - Answer: 
The corrected code should properly preprocess the transaction data, perform one-hot encoding, and generate association rules accurately.
```python
import pandas as pd
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import association_rules

# Load transaction data
df = pd.read_csv('transaction_data.csv')

# Convert data to transaction format
transactions = df.groupby('TransactionID')['Item'].apply(list)

# Create a list of unique items
items = list(set(df['Item']))

# Create an empty DataFrame to store one-hot encoded transaction data
one_hot_encoded = pd.DataFrame(0, index=transactions.index, columns=items)

# Update the one-hot encoded DataFrame based on transactions
for index, transaction in transactions.iteritems():
    one_hot_encoded.loc[index, transaction] = 1

# Find frequent itemsets using Apriori algorithm
frequent_itemsets = apriori(one_hot_encoded, min_support=0.1, use_colnames=True)

# Generate association rules
rules = association_rules(frequent_itemsets, metric='lift', min_threshold=1.0)

# Save the association rules to a new CSV file
rules.to_csv('association_rules.csv', index=False)
```
In the corrected code, we properly preprocess the transaction data and create an empty DataFrame to store one-hot encoded transaction data. We then update the one-hot encoded DataFrame based on transactions and generate association rules accurately. Additionally, we specify `index=False` while saving the association rules to a CSV file.
