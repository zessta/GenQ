Question 1

Absolutely, let's make the debugging questions more advanced by incorporating concepts like data cleaning, handling missing values, and optimizing performance.

0 - Real-life Application of Pandas: Customer Data Analysis

1 - Scenario: 
You are working on a project where you need to analyze customer data from an e-commerce platform. Your task involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and performing advanced analysis to identify customer trends and behavior.

2 - Buggy Code:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load customer data
df = pd.read_csv('customer_data.csv')

# Remove rows with missing values
df_cleaned = df.dropna()

# Convert 'Registration Date' column to datetime
df_cleaned['Registration Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df_cleaned['Registration Date'])

# Extract year from 'Registration Date' column
df_cleaned['Registration Year'] = df_cleaned['Registration Date'].dt.year

# Calculate the number of new registrations per year
new_registrations_per_year = df_cleaned.groupby('Registration Year').count()

# Save the result to a new CSV file
new_registrations_per_year.to_csv('new_registrations_per_year.csv')
```

3 - Question: 
Explain what issue you encounter in the code.

4 - Explanation: 
The code attempts to analyze new registrations per year but misses handling missing values properly and does not optimize the aggregation process for performance.

5 - Answer: 
The corrected code should handle missing values, optimize the aggregation process, and use a more appropriate method for counting new registrations per year.
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load customer data
df = pd.read_csv('customer_data.csv')

# Drop rows with missing values in the 'Registration Date' column
df_cleaned = df.dropna(subset=['Registration Date'])

# Convert 'Registration Date' column to datetime
df_cleaned['Registration Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df_cleaned['Registration Date'])

# Extract year from 'Registration Date' column
df_cleaned['Registration Year'] = df_cleaned['Registration Date'].dt.year

# Count new registrations per year
new_registrations_per_year = df_cleaned.groupby('Registration Year').size().reset_index(name='New Registrations')

# Save the result to a new CSV file
new_registrations_per_year.to_csv('new_registrations_per_year.csv', index=False)
```
In the corrected code, we handle missing values by dropping rows with missing registration dates. We then use the `size` method to count the number of new registrations per year, which is a more efficient approach. Additionally, we reset the index and specify `index=False` while saving the result to a CSV file.
