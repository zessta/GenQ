Question 2

0 - Real-life Application of Pandas: Web Traffic Analysis

1 - Scenario: 
You are working on a project where you need to analyze web traffic data from a popular website. Your task involves cleaning and preprocessing the data, identifying patterns in user behavior, and generating insights to optimize website performance.

2 - Buggy Code:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load web traffic data
df = pd.read_csv('web_traffic_data.csv')

# Convert 'Timestamp' column to datetime
df['Timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Timestamp'])

# Remove duplicate entries
df.drop_duplicates()

# Calculate total page views per day
daily_page_views = df.groupby(df['Timestamp'].dt.date)['Page Views'].sum()

# Calculate average time spent on the website per day
df['Time Spent'] = pd.to_timedelta(df['Time Spent'])
average_time_spent = df.groupby(df['Timestamp'].dt.date)['Time Spent'].mean()

# Merge the two DataFrames
daily_stats = pd.concat([daily_page_views, average_time_spent], axis=1, keys=['Page Views', 'Average Time Spent'])

# Save the result to a new CSV file
daily_stats.to_csv('daily_stats.csv')
```

3 - Question: 
Explain what issue you encounter in the code.

4 - Explanation: 
The code attempts to analyze web traffic data but has issues with removing duplicates, calculating total page views, and computing the average time spent on the website per day.

5 - Answer: 
The corrected code should properly handle duplicate entries, optimize the aggregation process for performance, and compute the average time spent on the website per day accurately.
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load web traffic data
df = pd.read_csv('web_traffic_data.csv')

# Convert 'Timestamp' column to datetime
df['Timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Timestamp'])

# Remove duplicate entries
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

# Calculate total page views per day
daily_page_views = df.groupby(df['Timestamp'].dt.date)['Page Views'].sum()

# Calculate average time spent on the website per day
df['Time Spent'] = pd.to_timedelta(df['Time Spent'])
average_time_spent = df.groupby(df['Timestamp'].dt.date)['Time Spent'].sum() / df.groupby(df['Timestamp'].dt.date)['Page Views'].count()

# Merge the two DataFrames
daily_stats = pd.concat([daily_page_views, average_time_spent], axis=1, keys=['Page Views', 'Average Time Spent'])

# Save the result to a new CSV file
daily_stats.to_csv('daily_stats.csv')
```
In the corrected code, we handle duplicate entries by using `inplace=True` in the `drop_duplicates` method. We accurately compute the average time spent on the website per day by dividing the total time spent by the number of page views. Additionally, we use the `sum()` function to aggregate time spent on the website per day.
