Question 14

Sure! Let's focus on a scenario that tests advanced Pandas concepts such as time series resampling, handling missing data, and using advanced aggregation and filtering operations.

0 - Real-life Application of Pandas: Environmental Data Analysis

1 - Scenario:
You are analyzing environmental data collected from various sensors measuring temperature, humidity, and air quality over time. Your task involves cleaning the data, resampling the time series data to a daily frequency, handling missing values, and performing advanced aggregations to generate summary statistics.

2 - Buggy Code:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load sensor data
df = pd.read_csv('environmental_data.csv')

# Convert 'Timestamp' column to datetime
df['Timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Timestamp'])

# Set 'Timestamp' as the index
df.set_index('Timestamp', inplace=True)

# Resample data to daily frequency
df_daily = df.resample('D').mean()

# Fill missing values with the mean of the column
df_daily.fillna(df.mean(), inplace=True)

# Calculate daily summary statistics
summary = df_daily.groupby(df_daily.index)['Temperature', 'Humidity', 'Air Quality'].agg(['mean', 'max', 'min'])

# Filter to get days with extreme temperature variations
extreme_days = summary[(summary['Temperature']['max'] - summary['Temperature']['min']) > 10]

# Save the result to a new CSV file
extreme_days.to_csv('extreme_days.csv')
```

3 - Question:
Explain what issue you encounter in the code.

4 - Explanation:
The code attempts to resample environmental data to a daily frequency, handle missing values, and perform advanced aggregations. However, it has issues with handling missing values properly, correctly applying groupby operations, and properly filtering the results.

5 - Answer:
The corrected code should properly handle missing values, correctly apply aggregation operations, and filter the results accurately.
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load sensor data
df = pd.read_csv('environmental_data.csv')

# Convert 'Timestamp' column to datetime
df['Timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Timestamp'])

# Set 'Timestamp' as the index
df.set_index('Timestamp', inplace=True)

# Resample data to daily frequency
df_daily = df.resample('D').mean()

# Fill missing values with the mean of the column
df_daily.fillna(df_daily.mean(), inplace=True)

# Calculate daily summary statistics
summary = df_daily.agg({'Temperature': ['mean', 'max', 'min'], 
                        'Humidity': ['mean', 'max', 'min'], 
                        'Air Quality': ['mean', 'max', 'min']})

# Filter to get days with extreme temperature variations
extreme_days = df_daily[(df_daily['Temperature'].max() - df_daily['Temperature'].min()) > 10]

# Save the result to a new CSV file
extreme_days.to_csv('extreme_days.csv')
```
In the corrected code, we:
- Fill missing values with the mean of each column after resampling (`df_daily.mean()`).
- Use `agg` to calculate daily summary statistics for temperature, humidity, and air quality.
- Correctly filter the days with extreme temperature variations by applying the condition on the resampled daily data (`df_daily`) instead of the summary statistics.

This ensures that the data is resampled, cleaned, and summarized accurately, providing useful insights into environmental conditions and identifying days with extreme variations.
