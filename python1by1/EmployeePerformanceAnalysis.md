Question 8

Certainly! Here's another scenario that tests advanced Pandas concepts:

0 - Real-life Application of Pandas: Employee Performance Analysis

1 - Scenario:
You are working on a project where you need to analyze employee performance data to evaluate productivity and identify high performers. Your task involves data cleaning, aggregating performance metrics, and generating insights for management.

2 - Buggy Code:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load employee performance data
df = pd.read_csv('employee_performance.csv')

# Fill missing values in the 'Performance Score' column with the mean
df['Performance Score'].fillna(df['Performance Score'].mean(), inplace=True)

# Convert 'Review Date' column to datetime
df['Review Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Review Date'])

# Extract the year and month from 'Review Date'
df['Year'] = df['Review Date'].dt.year
df['Month'] = df['Review Date'].dt.month

# Group by employee and calculate the average performance score per month
monthly_performance = df.groupby(['Employee ID', 'Year', 'Month'])['Performance Score'].mean()

# Pivot the table to have employees as rows and months as columns
pivot_table = monthly_performance.pivot(index='Employee ID', columns=['Year', 'Month'], values='Performance Score')

# Save the result to a new CSV file
pivot_table.to_csv('monthly_performance.csv')
```

3 - Question:
Explain what issue you encounter in the code.

4 - Explanation:
The code attempts to pivot the table to have employees as rows and months as columns, but it misses correctly resetting the index and properly handling the multi-index resulting from the `groupby` operation.

5 - Answer:
The corrected code should properly reset the index after the groupby operation and handle the multi-index appropriately before pivoting the table.
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load employee performance data
df = pd.read_csv('employee_performance.csv')

# Fill missing values in the 'Performance Score' column with the mean
df['Performance Score'].fillna(df['Performance Score'].mean(), inplace=True)

# Convert 'Review Date' column to datetime
df['Review Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Review Date'])

# Extract the year and month from 'Review Date'
df['Year'] = df['Review Date'].dt.year
df['Month'] = df['Review Date'].dt.month

# Group by employee and calculate the average performance score per month
monthly_performance = df.groupby(['Employee ID', 'Year', 'Month'])['Performance Score'].mean().reset_index()

# Pivot the table to have employees as rows and months as columns
pivot_table = monthly_performance.pivot_table(index='Employee ID', columns=['Year', 'Month'], values='Performance Score')

# Save the result to a new CSV file
pivot_table.to_csv('monthly_performance.csv')
```
In the corrected code, after grouping by employee and calculating the average performance score per month, we use `reset_index()` to flatten the multi-index. This ensures that the `pivot_table` method works correctly by properly restructuring the DataFrame into the desired format with employees as rows and months as columns.
