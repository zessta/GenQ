Question 5

0 - Real-life Application of Pandas: Social Media Engagement Analysis

1 - Scenario:
You are working on a project where you need to analyze engagement metrics from social media posts to understand user interaction and optimize content strategy. Your task involves preprocessing the data, calculating engagement rates, and identifying trends in user engagement.

2 - Buggy Code:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load social media data
df = pd.read_csv('social_media_data.csv')

# Convert 'Date' column to datetime
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])

# Calculate engagement rate
df['Engagement Rate'] = df['Likes'] / df['Impressions'] * 100

# Group by month and calculate average engagement rate
monthly_engagement = df.groupby(df['Date'].dt.month)['Engagement Rate'].mean()

# Save the result to a new CSV file
monthly_engagement.to_csv('monthly_engagement.csv')
```

3 - Question:
Explain what issue you encounter in the code.

4 - Explanation:
The code attempts to analyze social media engagement but has issues with aggregating data by month and calculating the average engagement rate.

5 - Answer:
The corrected code should properly aggregate the data by month and calculate the average engagement rate accurately.
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load social media data
df = pd.read_csv('social_media_data.csv')

# Convert 'Date' column to datetime
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])

# Calculate engagement rate
df['Engagement Rate'] = df['Likes'] / df['Impressions'] * 100

# Group by month and calculate average engagement rate
monthly_engagement = df.groupby(df['Date'].dt.month)['Engagement Rate'].mean()

# Convert the result to DataFrame
monthly_engagement_df = monthly_engagement.reset_index(name='Average Engagement Rate')

# Save the result to a new CSV file
monthly_engagement_df.to_csv('monthly_engagement.csv', index=False)
```
In the corrected code, we properly aggregate the data by month using `groupby` and calculate the average engagement rate. We reset the index and specify `index=False` while saving the result to a CSV file to avoid saving the index column.
