Question 7

Got it! Let's focus on bugs that are solely based on Pandas concepts:

0 - Real-life Application of Pandas: Retail Sales Analysis

1 - Scenario:
You are analyzing retail sales data to identify trends and patterns in customer purchasing behavior. Your task involves preprocessing the data, aggregating sales by different categories, and generating insights for business decisions.

2 - Buggy Code:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load sales data
df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

# Convert 'Date' column to datetime
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])

# Filter data for the current year
df_current_year = df[df['Date'].dt.year == 2023]

# Group by month and calculate total sales
monthly_sales = df_current_year.groupby(df_current_year['Date'].dt.month)['Sales'].sum()

# Save the result to a new CSV file
monthly_sales.to_csv('monthly_sales.csv')
```

3 - Question:
Explain what issue you encounter in the code.

4 - Explanation:
The code attempts to aggregate monthly sales for the current year but does not handle missing months properly, leading to incomplete or incorrect results.

5 - Answer:
The corrected code should ensure that all months are included in the aggregation, even if there are no sales recorded for some months.
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load sales data
df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

# Convert 'Date' column to datetime
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])

# Filter data for the current year
df_current_year = df[df['Date'].dt.year == 2023]

# Group by month and calculate total sales
monthly_sales = df_current_year.groupby(df_current_year['Date'].dt.month)['Sales'].sum()

# Reindex to include all months
monthly_sales = monthly_sales.reindex(range(1, 13), fill_value=0)

# Save the result to a new CSV file
monthly_sales.to_csv('monthly_sales.csv')
```
In the corrected code, after aggregating monthly sales, we reindex the result to include all months from January to December using `reindex` and fill any missing months with 0 sales using `fill_value=0`. This ensures that the output includes sales data for all months of the year.
