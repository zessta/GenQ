1 - Scenario
A company uses a Django application to manage orders and their corresponding invoices. Each time an order is placed, an invoice should be created and linked to the order. The developer wrote a method to handle this process, but it seems that sometimes invoices are not being created, causing inconsistencies.

2 - Code
```python
from django.db import models, transaction

class Order(models.Model):
    customer_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    order_date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    total_amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)

class Invoice(models.Model):
    order = models.ForeignKey(Order, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    invoice_date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    amount_due = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)

class OrderService:
    def create_order_with_invoice(self, customer_name, amount):
        order = Order(customer_name=customer_name, total_amount=amount)
        order.save()
        self.create_invoice(order)
    
    def create_invoice(self, order):
        invoice = Invoice(order=order, amount_due=order.total_amount)
        invoice.save()

# Using the service
service = OrderService()
service.create_order_with_invoice("John Doe", 150.00)
```

3 - Question
There seems to be an issue where invoices are not always created when an order is placed. Identify and explain the issue in the code.

4 - Explanation
The code does not handle potential errors that might occur when saving the order or creating the invoice. If an error occurs after the order is saved but before the invoice is saved, the order will exist without an associated invoice, causing data inconsistencies. This can happen if there is a database issue or some other unexpected exception.

5 - Answer
```python
from django.db import models, transaction

class Order(models.Model):
    customer_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    order_date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    total_amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)

class Invoice(models.Model):
    order = models.ForeignKey(Order, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    invoice_date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    amount_due = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)

class OrderService:
    def create_order_with_invoice(self, customer_name, amount):
        try:
            with transaction.atomic():
                order = Order(customer_name=customer_name, total_amount=amount)
                order.save()
                self.create_invoice(order)
        except Exception as e:
            # Handle exception or log error
            print(f"Error occurred: {e}")
    
    def create_invoice(self, order):
        invoice = Invoice(order=order, amount_due=order.total_amount)
        invoice.save()

# Using the service
service = OrderService()
service.create_order_with_invoice("John Doe", 150.00)
```
