NOTE:- Some of the solutions added here have intentional mistakes for interviews. From our experimentation with GPT, we are certain that they can be put in GPT for correction and you can get the right code. But the implementation would require only one prompt for one question and not add multiple questions in gpt to prevent GPT hallucination.
