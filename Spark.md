   - **Output**: Word count.
"""


Below is a Spark job implementation for the "Word Count with Custom Delimiter" task. This implementation includes some intentional mistakes to test the interviewee's understanding of Spark. 


```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import split, explode, col


def word_count(file_path, delimiter):
    # Initialize Spark session
    spark = SparkSession.builder \
        .appName("WordCountWithCustomDelimiter") \
        .getOrCreate()


    # Read text file into DataFrame
    lines = spark.read.text(file_path)


    # Split lines into words using the custom delimiter
    words = lines.select(explode(split(col("value"), delimiter)).alias("word"))


    # Count occurrences of each word
    word_counts = words.groupBy("words").count()  # Mistake: "words" should be "word"


    # Show the result
    word_counts.show()


    # Stop the Spark session
    spark.stop()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    file_path = "path/to/your/textfile.txt"  # Mistake: This should be passed as an argument
    delimiter = ","  # Mistake: This should be passed as an argument
    word_count(file_path, delimiter)
```


### Mistakes Introduced:
1. **Column Name in groupBy**:
   - Mistake: `word_counts = words.groupBy("words").count()`
   - Correction: The correct column name should be `word` not `words`.


2. **Hardcoded File Path and Delimiter**:
   - Mistake: `file_path = "path/to/your/textfile.txt"` and `delimiter = ","`
   - Correction: These should be passed as arguments to the script.


3. **Dependency on DataFrame API**:
   - Mistake: Using the DataFrame API for word count is not a mistake per se, but you could challenge the interviewee to use RDD transformations instead.


### Corrected Code:
Here's the corrected version of the code:


```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import split, explode, col
import sys


def word_count(file_path, delimiter):
    # Initialize Spark session
    spark = SparkSession.builder \
        .appName("WordCountWithCustomDelimiter") \
        .getOrCreate()


    # Read text file into DataFrame
    lines = spark.read.text(file_path)


    # Split lines into words using the custom delimiter
    words = lines.select(explode(split(col("value"), delimiter)).alias("word"))


    # Count occurrences of each word
    word_counts = words.groupBy("word").count()


    # Show the result
    word_counts.show()


    # Stop the Spark session
    spark.stop()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 3:
        print("Usage: word_count <file_path> <delimiter>")
        sys.exit(-1)


    file_path = sys.argv[1]
    delimiter = sys.argv[2]
    word_count(file_path, delimiter)
```


### Key Points to Test in an Interview:
1. **Understanding of SparkSession and DataFrame API**.
2. **Correct usage of DataFrame transformations like `split` and `explode`**.
3. **Proper handling and passing of command-line arguments**.
4. **Correct usage of `groupBy` and `count` for aggregations**.
5. **Ability to debug and fix common mistakes**.

Certainly! Below is a sample code that introduces some mistakes for the purpose of testing an interviewee's understanding of Apache Spark. The task is to detect anomalies in a time series dataset. The mistakes are intentionally added to test the candidate's debugging and problem-solving skills.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, avg, stddev

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("TimeSeriesAnomaliesDetection") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Sample data creation (mistake: timestamp should be in correct format)
data = [
    ("2023-01-01 00:00:00", 10),
    ("2023-01-01 01:00:00", 12),

# Filter anomalies (mistake: incorrect column name)
anomalies = df.filter(col("value") > threshold)

# Show the anomalies
anomalies.show()

# Stop the Spark session
spark.stop()
```

### Mistakes Introduced:

1. **Timestamp Format**: The timestamp should be in a format that Spark can correctly interpret as a timestamp.
2. **Grouping Issue**: The aggregation for mean and standard deviation should be done in the context of time windows or other relevant groupings if necessary.
3. **Threshold Calculation**: The threshold calculation is simplified and may need to be more sophisticated depending on the use case.
4. **Incorrect Column Name**: The filter condition should reference the correct column name in the DataFrame.
5. **Additional Context**: Depending on the complexity, additional context such as windowing functions or more complex anomaly detection logic may be required.

### Corrected Version:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Convert the data to a DataFrame
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["timestamp", "value"])

# Convert timestamp to proper format
df = df.withColumn("timestamp", to_timestamp(col("timestamp")))

# Calculate the mean and standard deviation
stats = df.agg(
    avg(col("value")).alias("mean"),
    stddev(col("value")).alias("stddev")

Certainly! Below is a sample code that creates an application to join two DataFrames (sales and customers) using Apache Spark. The code includes intentional mistakes that can be used to test the interviewee's understanding of Spark.


### Sample Code with Intentional Mistakes


```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col


# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("JoinTwoDataFrames") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Show the result
result_df.show()


# Stop the Spark session
spark.stop()
```


### Intentional Mistakes


1. **Column Name Mismatch**: In the join condition, `customers_df.id` should be `customers_df.customer_id`.
2. **DataFrame Column Selection**: The `select` statement uses `col("customer_id")` which is ambiguous if not properly aliased.
3. **Schema Definition**: The schema definitions use lists of strings instead of the correct `StructType` and `StructField` types.
4. **Data Types**: The schema does not enforce data types, which can lead to issues with data integrity.


### Corrected Code


Below is the corrected version of the code:


```python

    # Collect and print the final ranks
    for (link, rank) in ranks.collect():
        print(f"{link} has rank: {rank}")


    sc.stop()
```


### Intentional Mistakes:
1. **Parsing Function**: The `parse_neighbors` function splits the input by commas. If the input data uses a different delimiter, this will cause issues.
2. **URL Contributions**: The `compute_contribs` function yields contributions but does not handle the case where a URL has no outgoing links.
3. **Caching**: The ranks RDD is not cached, which can lead to recomputation in each iteration, making the algorithm inefficient.
4. **Initialization**: The initial rank of each URL is set to 1.0 without considering whether the URL actually exists in the input data.
5. **Iteration Convergence**: The number of iterations is hardcoded to 10. It should ideally converge based on a tolerance level.


These mistakes will help test the interviewee's ability to debug and optimize Spark applications, as well as their understanding of the PageRank algorithm.

1. **Window Specification Mistake**: The window specification `rowsBetween(-window_size, 0)` should be `rowsBetween(-window_size + 1, 0)` to include the current row in the window size.
2. **Import Mistake**: `from pyspark.sql.functions import col` is redundant as `col` is not directly used in the function. It should be removed.
3. **Data Type Mistake**: The `timestamp` column should be cast to a timestamp type for proper ordering. This is not done in the code.
4. **Function Documentation**: The function documentation does not specify the data type of `window_size`.

The corrected version should look like this:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.window import Window
from pyspark.sql.functions import avg

def calculate_moving_average(df, window_size):
    """
    Compute the moving average of a time series dataset.

    :param df: Input DataFrame with columns (timestamp, value)
    :param window_size: The window size for the moving average (int)
    :return: DataFrame with columns (timestamp, moving_average)
    """
    # Define the window specification
    window_spec = Window.orderBy("timestamp").rowsBetween(-window_size + 1, 0)

    # Calculate the moving average
    df_with_moving_avg = df.withColumn("moving_average", avg("value").over(window_spec))

    # Select the required columns
    result_df = df_with_moving_avg.select("timestamp", "moving_average")
    return result_df

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Initialize Spark session
    spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("MovingAverage").getOrCreate()

    # Sample data
    data = [
        ("2023-01-01 00:00:00", 10),
        ("2023-01-01 01:00:00", 20),
        ("2023-01-01 02:00:00", 30),
        ("2023-01-01 03:00:00", 40),
        ("2023-01-01 04:00:00", 50)
    ]

    # Create DataFrame
    columns = ["timestamp", "value"]
    df = spark.createDataFrame(data, columns)

    # Cast timestamp column to timestamp type
    df = df.withColumn("timestamp", df["timestamp"].cast("timestamp"))

    # Define window size
    window_size = 2

    # Compute moving average
    result_df = calculate_moving_average(df, window_size)

    # Show the result
    result_df.show()

    # Stop Spark session
    spark.stop()
```

This corrected version addresses the mistakes and should work correctly for computing the moving average in a Spark DataFrame.

Certainly! Below is a piece of Spark code that implements K-means clustering, but I've introduced some intentional mistakes for testing purposes. The code can be used on coding platforms like HackerRank or Coderbyte to assess the interviewee's understanding of Spark and K-means clustering.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler
from pyspark.ml.clustering import KMeans

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("KMeans Clustering Example") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Sample data
data = [
    (0.0, 0.0),
    (0.1, 0.1),
    (0.2, 0.2),
    (9.0, 9.0),
    (9.1, 9.1),
    (9.2, 9.2)
]

# Create DataFrame
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["x", "y"])

# Assemble features
assembler = VectorAssembler(
    inputCols=["x", "y"],
    outputCol="features"
)
feature_df = assembler.transform(df)

# Set K for KMeans
K = 2

# Apply KMeans
kmeans = KMeans().setK(k).setSeed(1)
model = kmeans.fit(feature_df)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.transform(feature_df)

# Show results
predictions.show()

# Stop Spark session
spark.stop()
```

### Intentional Mistakes:
1. **DataFrame Column Names**: The DataFrame columns are named "x" and "y", but the VectorAssembler expects columns named "features" for input.
2. **KMeans Parameter**: The variable for the number of clusters `K` is set but not used in the `KMeans` model. Instead, a variable `k` is used which is not defined.      
3. **Column Selection**: The final `predictions` DataFrame does not select the original data columns along with the cluster assignments.

### Corrected Code:
```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler
from pyspark.ml.clustering import KMeans

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("KMeans Clustering Example") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Sample data
data = [
    (0.0, 0.0),
    (0.1, 0.1),
    (0.2, 0.2),
    (9.0, 9.0),
    (9.1, 9.1),
    (9.2, 9.2)
]

# Create DataFrame
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["x", "y"])

# Assemble features
assembler = VectorAssembler(
    inputCols=["x", "y"],
    outputCol="features"
)
feature_df = assembler.transform(df)

# Set K for KMeans
K = 2

# Apply KMeans
kmeans = KMeans().setK(K).setSeed(1)  # Corrected to use K instead of k
model = kmeans.fit(feature_df)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.transform(feature_df)

# Select original data and cluster assignments
result = predictions.select("x", "y", "prediction")

# Show results
result.show()

# Stop Spark session
spark.stop()
```

### Key Points for Interviewees:
1. **Understanding of DataFrame Operations**: Ability to manipulate and transform DataFrames.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Using VectorAssembler to prepare data for machine learning models.
3. **KMeans Clustering**: Correctly setting parameters and interpreting the output.
4. **Debugging Skills**: Identifying and fixing mistakes in the code.

This setup will help interviewers assess the candidate's proficiency with Spark and their problem-solving skills.

Sure! Below is a sample code to create a Spark application that parses a log file and computes aggregate statistics. This code includes intentional mistakes to test the interviewee's understanding of Spark concepts.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, count

def parse_log_file(log_file_path, aggregation_key):
    # Initialize Spark session
    spark = SparkSession.builder \

    aggregated_df = parse_log_file(log_file_path, aggregation_key)
    aggregated_df.show()

    # Stop the Spark session
    spark.stop()
```

### Mistakes Introduced:
1. **InferSchema Issue**: The `inferSchema` parameter is set to `True`, which might not infer the schema correctly for large datasets. It is better to define the schema explicitly.
2. **Column Name**: The `aggregation_key` is hardcoded as `"column_name"`, which might not exist in the log file.
3. **Stopping Spark Session**: The `spark` variable used in `spark.stop()` is not defined in the main block.
4. **File Path**: The path to the log file is hardcoded and might not be valid.
5. **Error Handling**: There is no error handling for exceptions that might occur during file reading or aggregation.

### Corrected Code:
Below is the corrected version of the code:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, count

def parse_log_file(log_file_path, aggregation_key):
    # Initialize Spark session

    # Read the log file into a DataFrame

    # Check if the aggregation key exists in the DataFrame
    if aggregation_key not in logs_df.columns:
        raise ValueError(f"Aggregation key '{aggregation_key}' does not exist in the log file.")

    # Aggregate statistics based on the aggregation key
    aggregated_df = logs_df.groupBy(aggregation_key).agg(count("*").alias("count"))

    return aggregated_df, spark

if __name__ == "__main__":
    log_file_path = "path/to/log/file.csv"  # Ensure this path is valid
    aggregation_key = "level"  # Example aggregation key

    try:
        aggregated_df, spark = parse_log_file(log_file_path, aggregation_key)
        aggregated_df.show()

        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    finally:
        # Stop the Spark session
        spark.stop()
```

### How to Test:
1. **Upload the log file**: Ensure the log file is uploaded to the coding platform.
2. **Run the script**: Execute the script and observe the output.
3. **Check for Errors**: Validate whether the errors are correctly handled and whether the aggregation is performed as expected.

Certainly! Below is a sample code for a Spark job to perform graph processing using GraphX to find connected components. The code includes intentional mistakes for the interviewee to identify and correct.

### Mistakes Introduced:
1. Missing SparkContext initialization.
2. Incorrect method for reading the input file.
3. Incorrect method for creating the graph.
4. Incorrect method for finding connected components.
5. Incorrect action for collecting the results.

### Code:

```python
from pyspark import SparkConf, SparkContext
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from graphframes import GraphFrame

def main():
    # Mistake 1: Missing SparkContext initialization
    conf = SparkConf().setAppName("GraphProcessingWithGraphX")

    edges_df = spark.createDataFrame(edges, ["src", "dst", "relationship"])

    # Mistake 4: Incorrect method for finding connected components

    result = graph.connectedComponents()

    # Mistake 5: Incorrect action for collecting the results
    connected_components = result.collect()

    for row in connected_components:
        print(row)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Corrected Code:

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
from pyspark import SparkConf, SparkContext
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from graphframes import GraphFrame

def main():
    # Corrected: Initialize SparkSession with GraphFrames support
    spark = SparkSession.builder \

        .config("spark.jars.packages", "graphframes:graphframes:0.8.2-spark3.0-s_2.12") \
        .getOrCreate()
    sc = spark.sparkContext

    # Corrected: Read the input file properly
    input_file = "graph_edges.txt"
    edges_rdd = sc.textFile(input_file).map(lambda line: line.split())

    # Corrected: Create vertices and edges dataframes correctly
    vertices = edges_rdd.flatMap(lambda edge: [(edge[0],), (edge[1],)]).distinct()
    edges = edges_rdd.map(lambda edge: (edge[0], edge[1]))
    vertices_df = vertices.toDF(["id"])
    edges_df = edges.toDF(["src", "dst"])

    # Corrected: Use GraphFrame to find connected components
    graph = GraphFrame(vertices_df, edges_df)
    result = graph.connectedComponents()

    # Corrected: Collect the results properly
    connected_components = result.select("id", "component").collect()

    for row in connected_components:
        print(row)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of Corrections:
1. **SparkContext Initialization**: Initialize `SparkSession` with GraphFrames support and obtain `SparkContext` from it.
2. **Reading Input File**: Use `sc.textFile(input_file).map(lambda line: line.split())` to properly read and split the lines.
3. **Creating Graph**: Use `toDF` to create DataFrames for vertices and edges.
4. **Finding Connected Components**: Use `graph.connectedComponents()` to get the connected components.
5. **Collecting Results**: Use `select` and `collect` to gather the results properly.

This corrected code can be tested on platforms like HackerRank or Coderbyte after setting up the appropriate environment for Spark and GraphFrames.

### Mistakes Introduced
1. **Incorrect Column Name for Deduplication**:

2. **Incorrect Column Names While Creating DataFrame**:
   - The DataFrame is created with column names `["identifier", "data_value"]` instead of `["id", "data"]`.

### Test Cases
To test the interviewee, you can ask them to:
1. Identify and correct the incorrect column name used in the `dropDuplicates` function.
2. Correct the column names used while creating the DataFrame.

### Corrected Code
For reference, here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col

    return deduplicated_df

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Sample data
    data = [
        (1, "data1"),
        (2, "data2"),
        (1, "data1"),  # duplicate row
        (3, "data3")
    ]

    columns = ["id", "data"]

    # Create DataFrame
    input_df = spark.createDataFrame(data, columns)

### Mistakes to be identified by the interviewee:
1. **Missing import of `Tokenizer`**: The `Tokenizer` class is used but not imported initially.
2. **Incorrect column name for `HashingTF`**: The `inputCol` for `HashingTF` should match the output of the `Tokenizer`.
3. **Incorrectly assuming features are `DenseVector`**: The features generated by `HashingTF` and IDF are usually sparse vectors, but the code assumes they are dense.     
4. **Incorrect column names in the select statement**: The columns selected after the self-join should correspond to the correct aliases used in the join.

Sure! Below is a Spark application code that is designed to find anomalies in a time series dataset. I've intentionally introduced some mistakes for testing purposes. The code is structured in a way that it can be tested and run on coding platforms like HackerRank or Coderbyte.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, stddev, mean, abs

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("AnomalyDetection").getOrCreate()

# Sample input data for testing
data = [
    ("2023-01-01 00:00:00", 10.0),
    ("2023-01-01 01:00:00", 12.0),
    ("2023-01-01 02:00:00", 11.5),
    ("2023-01-01 03:00:00", 50.0),  # Anomaly
    ("2023-01-01 04:00:00", 10.5),
    ("2023-01-01 05:00:00", 11.0),
    ("2023-01-01 06:00:00", 10.8),
    ("2023-01-01 07:00:00", 9.0),   # Anomaly
]

# Convert the sample data to a DataFrame
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, ["timestamp", "value"])

# Calculate mean and standard deviation of the 'value' column
stats = df.select(
    mean(col("value")).alias("mean"),
    stddev(col("value")).alias("stddev")
).collect()[0]

mean_value = stats.mean
stddev_value = stats.stddev

# Define anomaly detection threshold
threshold = 2  # Mistake: This threshold might be too low or too high for some datasets

# Detect anomalies
anomalies = df.withColumn(
    "anomaly",
    abs(col("value") - mean_value) > (threshold * stddev_value)
).filter(col("anomaly") == True)

# Select only the timestamp and value columns for the output
anomalies = anomalies.select("timestamp", "value")

# Show the anomalies
anomalies.show()

# Stop the Spark session
spark.stop()
```

### Mistakes Introduced:
1. **Threshold Selection**: The threshold value for anomaly detection is hard-coded to `2`, which might not be suitable for all datasets. A better approach would be to parameterize this value or calculate it based on data properties.
2. **Column Naming**: The code uses the column name "value" and "timestamp" directly. It could be more robust by checking the existence of these columns or allowing dynamic column names.
3. **DataFrame Creation**: The sample data is directly embedded in the code. This should be parameterized, or the code should be capable of reading from an external source.
4. **Error Handling**: There is no error handling for cases where the DataFrame might be empty or the standard deviation might be zero.

### Task for Interviewee:
1. Fix the threshold issue by parameterizing it or improving the logic.
2. Add error handling for edge cases such as empty DataFrames or zero standard deviation.
3. Make the code more robust by checking for the existence of required columns.
4. Parameterize the input data source to make the code more flexible.

This should provide a comprehensive test of the interviewee's knowledge of Spark and their ability to write robust and flexible code.
